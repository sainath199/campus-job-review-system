The Campus Job Review System is a Flask App which has a SQL database for storage. It is created using Python.This website allows NCSU students to read reviews of any job that is open on campus. The portal's objective is to assist students in better comprehending the job description and the work through the experiences of their fellow students. Students can post reviews on the website for others to read. The pupils' anonymity is preserved so they can submit candid evaluations. Furthermore, the website offers user account management, allowing users to store their Resume and contact details. Only that specific user can modify these details after logging in (using the Account Page).

## Pre-requisites
To execute these scripts, your computer must have Python installed. For the latest Python version, please visit [Python Installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can use requirements.txt to install other requirements in addition to that. The requirements.txt file has been updated in light of the advancements made.

## Installation
Initially you can check whether your system has python pre-installed or not, usually nowadays in most of the systems, be it Windows or MacOS, python is pre-installed. 

To check whether you have python installed or not, you can open CMD or a Terminal and run the command "python --version". If the CMD shows the version such as Python 3.6.7 then your system already has python installed and you just need to clone the repository and run the python scripts. 

If this is not the case, then you need to download python installer package from [Python Installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/) based on your system's operating system and install it and you can further clone this repository to execute the scripts.

You can refer [Install.md](https://github.com/sainath199/campus-job-review-system/blob/main/install.md) for the complete installation steps based on your OS.

## Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python -m pytest test/
```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```

Please note: A coverage below 70% will cause the build to fail.
